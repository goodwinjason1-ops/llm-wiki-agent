You can run your own VPS for free forever. 
That's with four CPUs, 24 gigs of RAM, 200   gigs of storage, and 10 TB of network bandwidth. 
We'll use Oracle Cloud. And it's tricky, but I've   been using it for the last couple of years, and 
I'll show you exactly how to set it up so you   have no account bands, networking headaches, 
and how to get around capacity issues. Plus,   I'll show you tools to manage your server and 
easily deploy self-hosted applications that   can save you hundreds every month. Let's 
get started. First, what are you getting?   A VPS is like a computer that you can rent. So, 
instead of actually having physical access to it,   you connect to it or the internet. Just like your 
own computer, you get full access to the system.   That means you can log in as root. And because 
it's virtual, it's not really a computer you're   getting. It's a computer inside of a computer. But 
this is a lot better than shared hosting because   you have your own dedicated resources. And Oracle 
free tier gives you a generous amount of those   resources including compute, storage, and network. 
For compute, you can choose between ARM powered   ampere processors or AMD processors. With AMD, you 
can run older applications that require the x86 or   x64 like the old Intel processors. But I recommend 
choosing ARM because you get a lot more capacity   with that. And they even throw in a few hundred 
in trial credits that you can use to experiment.   Now, it's not as easy as a simple one-click VPS 
provider. There are capacity restrictions and   things you need to do to keep your machines 
active. Otherwise, Oracle can reclaim your   VPS. Don't worry, I'll show you tips for how to 
navigate all of that along the way. So, let's sign   up for Oracle Cloud and set up our account. To do 
that, you can just click the link here and then   that's going to bring you to the signup page. 
You will need to provide them with your credit   card details. So make sure you select your actual 
billing country and region. And then secondly,   sometimes this can be finicky even just to like 
set up your account. So to minimize the chances   of your account getting banned or you know not 
even getting created in the first place. Please   just use your real details. Don't use like a 
VPN, a temporary email or anything like that.   Okay? So go ahead and fill that out. And once 
you've done that, go ahead and hit verify email   and click the link that was sent to you. And then 
on the next page, you'll have to set a password,   select your customer type. I selected individual, 
and that's completely fine. Ask you to set a cloud   account name. Make sure you make a note of what 
this is. You'll need this to log in. Lastly,   it's going to ask you to select your home region. 
This is important. So you can go ahead and select   something that's really close to you, but you 
might run into capacity issues down the road. So   to avoid that, you can check this page on regions 
and availability domains. And then down here,   you can see all of the regions and how many 
availability domains they have. If you want   to maximize your chance of getting around 
any capacity issues, select something that   actually has more than one availability 
domain. If I was in the UK, for example,   I would select the UK south region as opposed to 
the west region because there's more availability   domains. And if you're closer to the US, you can 
pick one of these three regions. I've heard that   the Ashurn region is usually full. Probably would 
be better to go with Phoenix or Chicago. And this   is really important because anything that you 
spin up in the free tier will only work for   your home region. So, it's worth checking this 
list and picking something that's close to you,   but also has a high number of availability. And 
we're just going to continue with that. Now, it's   going to ask you for your address. So, go ahead 
and fill that in along with your phone number.   Hit continue. Here, it's going to ask you for 
your payment method. Again, you won't be charged   anything for using the free tier, but just to 
verify that you're a real person, they will do a   $1 charge and then reverse it. Also important here 
is that there's no virtual, prepaid, or single-use   cards allowed. So, you will need to enter in 
your real credit or debit card information. So, go ahead and enter in either your credit 
or debit card information in here. And once   you've entered that in, hit finish. It's 
going to validate that information for you.   And here you can see it worked out for me. Okay, 
so I'm going to hit close, hit start your free   trial. And if you did everything correctly, you 
will not hit this error or you might get some   error like this. And if you did run into that 
error, you can try again with your actual details.   But I highly recommend you do it right the first 
time because otherwise it's going to put you in   this whole loop of trying to even just create 
an account. So if you did all that correctly,   you'll get an email saying you can get started 
with Oracle Cloud along with your account name   and access details. So congratulations, you now 
have a free tier Oracle Cloud account set up. And   now we can go ahead and sign into that account. 
Just go ahead and click the link in that email. Or   you can come to the main page here and just click 
sign in. Here you're going to have to enter your   account name, your username, password. Again, 
click sign in. And here it's going to ask you   to set up your two-factor authentication. Plug in 
your two-factor code and then hit verify. And once   you do that, you'll end up at the homepage. 
Just to really quickly give you an overview,   you can go into the main menu here. You can 
search for any of the resources here. So,   congratulations. You have your account all set 
up and you're logged in. Now, let's go ahead and   actually use it. Before you set up your server, 
you're going to need a way to communicate with   your server, and that is essentially a network. 
So, essentially, this is you. You're going to go   to the internet. The internet's going to talk to 
the Oracle server and the Oracle server will have   the virtual cloud network to be able to talk to 
your server machine. This virtual cloud network   actually has a few different components that we 
need to set up. And here's what they look like.   Now, don't worry, you're not going to need to know 
all of these details. We're actually going to use   a wizard that's going to set up that and a lot 
of other different details for you. But the main   things that you'll need to know is that your VCN 
will have an internet gateway to let it talk to   the internet. It'll have subnets to connect to one 
or more of your servers. And lastly, it's going to   have security lists to be able to control access 
to which ports you open. And just to minimize   errors and headaches down the road, it's really 
important that we do this first before we go   ahead and create our instance or the machine. So 
to do this, we're going to go into our menu here,   networking, and then click overview. Here you'll 
see there's a few different options. We're going   to select the first option for creating a VCN with 
internet connectivity. And you can see that it   sets up all these things for you. So let's start 
that wizard. Just give it any name. We can leave   everything else as default. and then go ahead and 
click next and hit create. It's going to set up   all of those different components for you. And 
once you're done, you can click view VCN. It's   going to bring you to this page showing you 
that it is now available. Now that you have   your network available, the next thing is to go 
ahead and create your server. In Oracle's world,   this is called an instance. So go to the menu, 
go to compute and go in instances. Go ahead and   click create instance. Give it a name. And 
here you'll see I have three availability   domains available. If you chose a region with 
just one, then this won't be an option for you.   And under image and shape, this is I think where 
it's really important to make sure you select the   right stuff. The image is the operating system. By 
default, it comes with Oracle Linux. We're going   to change this to Ubuntu, which is still free 
and gives us a bit more of a standard operating   system to work with. I'm going to select the 
latest here. I'm selecting a minimal build,   which means it won't install a lot of stuff by 
default. And I'm going to select aarch64 which   will let me use Ampere processors. So click 
select. And here is where we configure what   kind of machine and how much processing 
power it has. So click change shape. And   you'll be able to select between AMD and Ampere 
processors. If you look at the details here,   you can set the number of CPUs and the memory 
you want this to use. This brings us to our   next decision of how we allocate capacity. And 
there's a few different ways to do this. You   can create one big instance and that will be a 
single server but a powerful one. You can have   four small servers and split that capacity up 
equally or you can split that up two ways. I'm   going to go with option three. And there's a 
couple of different reasons for that. One is   your public IP addresses. Oracle only gives you 
two. So I can have both of these linked to their   own IP. Now you can get around that IP limitation 
by using something called Oracle Bastion and you   can refer to the Oracle documentation for how 
to set that up. Two, this gives me enough of a   capacity to run any intensive tasks. And three, 
I can use these as uh a stable production server   and a sandbox for just experimenting and tinkering 
with stuff. So, I'm going to set it up that way,   but you should set it up based on how you want to 
configure it. To do that, I'm going to select amp   year, and then I'm going to assign two CPUs 
and 12 gigs of RAM. Click select shape. I'll   leave everything else as default. Click 
next. For security, again, defaults. So,   click next. And then here's the important part, 
the networking. because we already set that up,   you should be able to select an existing network 
and then select the network that we just created.   And because we did that here, you'll see that it's 
actually going to be able to assign a public IPv4   address. And if you come down here, make sure you 
download both the private and the public key. This   will make sure you can actually connect to it when 
we set it up. Click next. Here you can specify a   custom boot volume size. And I'm going to set 
that up to 100. And again, this is because I'm   going to go with this option here. And everything 
else stays default. And we're going to click next.   Here it's going to give you all the information 
that you selected. So you can go through this   and just verify everything one more time. And 
once you're done, go ahead and click create. And here's the problem. Chances are you're going 
to run into this, which is an out of capacity   error. Don't worry, that's an expected error. 
If you see it, I'll show you how to get around   it. Basically, Oracle's free tier has limited 
capacity. So, it will only create an instance   once that capacity is freed up by some other user 
somewhere else. So, if you saw this error, there's   a couple of ways to get around this. The first way 
is to really just spam the create button. You can   click create every 30 seconds manually, but if 
you don't want to spend your time doing that,   there is a script that will go in and do that 
for you. So, let me show you how to use that. So,   in Chrome, you can go into JavaScript console and 
then here where it says top, you can go ahead and   select the sandbox for Oracle. And then I 
found a script on Reddit here that you can   use and I'll paste the script in. Chances are you 
might not be able to paste it in and in that case   you might need to type in allow pasting. So if I 
hit enter, yeah, that looks right here. You can   see that it clicked create, but it wasn't able 
to do it. And so 30 seconds later, it's going   to go ahead and try to click create. I can filter 
this by pressing clicked. It went ahead and tried   to click that four to five times. And the cool 
thing about this script is you can see that it's   actually trying all three different regions just 
in case there's availability. And as you can see,   my script actually came in and tried to create 
an instance, but it failed. So, you know,   the script is useful. So, you can leave the 
script running and see if that works for you. Now,   if you do get this to work, just know that Oracle 
does have a policy on idle compute instances. So,   make sure you have either your CPU being utilized 
or your network or memory being utilized. But if   you follow the next method, you don't have to 
worry about that. If that script didn't work   for you, there is a second method, which is to 
upgrade your account to pay as you go. you will   have to enter your credit card information and 
it's going to do a temporary charge of $100 that   it's going to reverse. But the good thing is once 
you upgrade to pay as you go, you can create your   instance fairly easily and you can stop and start 
it at any time without worrying about giving up   your capacity. But I really recommend doing this 
if you're able to. And here's how to do it. Go   into your menu. Go to billing and cost management. 
Go into upgrade and manage payment. So, this page   should typically let me upgrade to a pay as you go 
account, but I've just created this account. So,   you can see that it's still provisioning. For me, 
it took about half an hour. And here you can see   that my plan type is tier. I'm going to go ahead 
and add a payment method before I can upgrade my   account to pay as you go. And then you can go 
ahead and fill in your details here. And now I   can go ahead and select upgrade my account to pay 
as you go. And essentially what this does is it   can charge the credit card for any usage that you 
go beyond your always free. So go ahead and click   upgrade your account. Your upgrade is in progress. 
For me that pay as you go process took maybe 30   minutes of waiting. Now, if you set up pay as you 
go and you're worried about it charging your card,   you can prevent that by going into billing budgets 
and then creating a new budget with a limit of   $1. So, you can create that here. And now it 
can't charge you for anything more than the limit   you set. Okay. So, I am on a payasyougo account 
now. So hopefully after your account's upgraded,   you can go in, repeat the same steps and start 
up your server. But if you're not able to do   that and you still need a VPS, let me show you a 
workaround. I did a lot of research for this and   I found something that I would personally use and 
recommend and that's something called Zeabur. This   is not your typical VPS provider, but once you log 
in, you can go in and buy a server from them. And   they have some really good deals right now. For 
example, if I want a small server, I can sort   by price. And here you can see for $2 a month, I 
can get a good tencent server located in the US.   I'd personally recommend upgrading that to 4 gigs 
because you get a lot more network bandwidth for   that for just an extra dollar a month. It's also 
really good because once you have your server set   up, you can just go in and instantly deploy a lot 
of preconfigured templates for popular services   like OpenClaw, n8n SillyTavern, WordPress. You 
can have your own Postgres instance here. And   if you do this, you can still follow the rest of 
the tips I give along the way for how to connect   to your server as well as how to make it easy to 
manage. And $3 a month for a server of this specs   is genuinely a good deal. And it's monthly, so 
you're not signing up for 12 or 24 months like you   would do with some other providers. And I do have 
a referral link in the description that will give   you an extra 20% off. So go ahead and use that 
link if you really do need a VPS and can't set one   up using Oracle. If you got around that capacity 
workaround by either upgrading your account or the   script worked for you, then it's going to start 
provisioning. And here, this will let you monitor   and manage that server. So once it's started, you 
can see how much resources it's using. And then   here on the details page is where it's going to 
give you all the information about that server.   Now let's go ahead and start the server. And you 
can see it's starting now. And now it shows us   running. Okay, great. So we have our networking 
and our server set up. But how do we actually   connect to it and use it? Now that our instance is 
up and running, let's connect to it. We're going   to connect to it using SSH, which is a secure 
way to connect to your remote server. To do this,   we are going to have to go into the command line. 
But don't worry, I will show you another way to   do it as well. But here are all the steps that 
we're going to take. We're going to follow the   Mac instructions, but if you're on Windows, 
it's also fairly easy to do. And here are the   instructions you're going to need for that. The 
first thing we're going to need is the key files   that we downloaded. This is a good idea to rename 
and back up these keys because without these you   will not be able to get back into your computer. 
And first we're going to change the permissions   on this by running this first command. And we're 
going to do that on the private key which ends in   key. And you can just drag and drop the key file 
after writing that command. Great. Now we won't   run into any permission issues. Now we're going 
to connect to our server with SSH -i and then   here we're going to drag and drop the key file 
again. And now we're going to need the username   and the IP address of our server. So if you go 
back to Oracle here under your instance details,   there's a section called instance access. Here 
you'll see the public IP address and the username.   So I'm going to copy the IP address. The username 
is Ubuntu at IP address. And then if I hit enter,   it's going to connect to my server. If you're 
doing this for the first time, you might see a   message warning you you haven't connected before. 
So just go ahead and type in yes. Great. So we're   logged into our system. Now, if this feels a 
little intimidating, another way to do this is   to use a software called Xpipe. Xpipe is free for 
the community edition. So go ahead and download   that. And essentially, this lets you manage all of 
your SSH connections and VPS servers in the same   place. So once you install it, you can go ahead 
and add a new remote host SSH connection. Here   I'm going to type in the address. The port is set 
as default. User identity, this is Ubuntu is the   username. There is no password. And yes, we are 
using a keybased authentication. Here I can either   browse and provide it my key file or I can type in 
the key file. I'm going to type it in just to show   you how that works. And that way you don't have to 
worry about which directory or where to save that   key file. So for the key file, you can open that 
with any text editor. And then uh I'm going to   paste that in here. There's no passphrase required 
for this. And I'll give this a connection name. And then it's going to test that connection. 
And if everything's good, we can hit okay. And   then now I just have to double click on this and 
it's going to open a new terminal window. So I   don't really have to remember all of these other 
commands. It also gives you a file browser option   here. So if I go onto the file browser here, I can 
look at all the files that are on my server now.   And for example, if I wanted to download my 
profile or if I wanted to download any other   files, I can do that using this interface. And 
I can also upload files here. So hopefully that   makes things a little bit easier to manage. Now 
that we're connected to our server since this is   the first time we've set it up, we're going to 
run a few commands on here that will update the   system and just make it a little bit more secure. 
So first, we're going to update the system by   running this first command. and it's going to go 
ahead and download all those packages and upgrade   your system for you. Because this is a remote 
server, we want to make sure it's secure. So,   we're going to install a firewall on here. 
The command to do that is apt install ufw. Okay, so our firewall is installed, but we 
still need to turn it on. But before we do that,   we want to make sure we don't lock 
ourselves out. So before we enable it,   we're going to allow these three ports 
to connect. SSH is what we're using   now. Port 80 and ports 443 are to allow 
standard HTTP and HTTP secure traffic. Now that we've added those rules, we can turn 
on the firewall. Here it's giving me a warning   saying it might disrupt the operation because 
I've allowed SSH. I can go ahead and say yes.   Okay. And now firewall is active and enabled 
on system startup. This is also a good time to   install any other utilities that you might need 
like curl or git or anything else that you know   you're going to need the server for. And lastly, 
we're logged in as Ubuntu. But if you need root   access for anything, you can always type in 
pseudo su. And that will log you in as the   root user. But I would advise you to stay out of 
that unless you really need it. And you can get   out of that by typing exit. So we've connected to 
our server. We've updated everything. And we've   added a firewall inside of our server. I will 
quickly say that with Oracle there is the VCN   security rules that you might need to change and 
I'll show you how to do that in just a minute as   well. But how do we actually make this easier to 
manage? Now that we have our server available,   how do we make it so that you're spending time 
using the server as opposed to doing a lot of   admin and managing the server? So what I 
recommend for this is installing Coolify.   Coolify is an open source community powered 
software that makes it easier to manage your   server. There's no hidden costs. It's fully 
open source. There's no limitations and it   gives you a nice UI to manage your server and any 
applications on top of it. So to install this,   you can simply copy this command and paste it back 
in the terminal. Hit enter and it's going to go   ahead and set up all the dependencies and install 
everything for you. And once it's finished,   you'll see a message congratulating you, as 
well as an IP address and an access port,   which is 8,000. So if I copy paste this back 
into my browser, it won't work because we haven't   opened up this port 8,000. So let's go ahead and 
quickly do that. pseudo UFW allow 8,000. And then   like I said, the the firewall we installed is here 
within our computer, but there's Oracle security   rules as well. And so to manage those, if you go 
back to your instance and go to networking here,   you'll see that I have the VCN attached here. 
And if you click on the public subnet and go   to security here, there's the default security 
list. And that has these security rules. This   shows you that only port 22 is allowed, which 
is why we can connect using the terminal. So   we're going to add some ingress rules here that 
open up traffic to other ports that we need.   So to add the rule, we're going to type in a range 
of IP addresses here, which is just all zeros. And   we're going to open up those same ports. So 
80. And then we're going to do that one more   time for 443. And then one more time, we're going 
to do that for the Coolify port, which is 8,000.   And when we're done with that, we can come to the 
bottom right here and add those rules. Now, if I   refresh this page, Coolify pops up, asks me to 
register my user. So, I'll just quickly go ahead   and do that and hit create account. Let's just 
quickly set this up just to show you what you're   getting. I can connect it to a remote server 
as well, but I'm on my own machine here. So,   let's do that. And here you can create your first 
project, which is just a container of different   applications you can install. And to look at that, 
we can go to try and deploy our first resource. Now, before we do that, we can see Coolify is 
giving us a warning here that it cannot connect   to the real-time service. And again, that's more 
ports that we need to open. So the Coolify docs   also tell you to open up 6001 and 6002. So 
I'm just going to do that in Oracle here. And because this is a range, I can 
just create a single rule for these. And I'll also allow those on my server here. And now when I come back, that warning is gone. 
So great. Now that we've set up Coolify and we   can access it, let's take a quick look at it. Here 
you can see that we can deploy applications using   GitHub and public or private repositories, using 
Docker Compose files. You can deploy databases,   and there's a whole range of services that it 
lets you deploy with one click. And this is a   great way to replace any existing applications 
that you might subscribe to with open-source   self-hosted stuff. So, for example, you can 
host your own book library. You can host your   own audiobookshelf. You can run a Bitcoin node 
on it and just a whole range of other useful   applications that now you can deploy on your free 
VPS. If this still feels like a lot, there's also   another application called Dokploy. I have used 
this as well and I found this to be a little bit   more beginner friendly. So, if Coolify still is 
feels like a lot, you can try Dokploy as well.   And so for example, I'm going to deploy 
audiobookshelf so that I can cancel my   audible subscription. And here you can see that 
it's already loaded in this docker compose file   for you and we'll configure everything as soon as 
you click deploy. So it finished deploying that   application for me. And if I go into the settings 
for that service, you can see it even gave me a   domain name I can now access that service with. 
And so here my audible clone is already set up   and ready to use. This also solves the problem 
of backups because you can go in here and if you   have an S3 storage available, you can back up your 
server there. If you need to access your terminal,   you can access it through here. You can 
also access your terminals for the actual   containers here as well. So it's a great way to 
manage your VPS. Okay, so that's it. You have   your server up and running. You have a way to 
connect to it and you have a way to manage it.
